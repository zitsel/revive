	Pre-Owned Condition Ratings - What Do They Mean?
    </b>
    <br />
    <br />
    All of our pre-owned items are rating on a scale of one to five. With one being an item that is damaged and needs repaired to a five being like-new.    <br />
    <br />
    <b>
	5/5 - Like New Condition
    <b/>
    <br />
    Item is in like new condition. There is no evidence that the item has been previously worn. Perfect, flawless condition. Pockets remain sewn shut on jackets, soles of shoes have zero wear, etc. 
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>
	4/5 - Excellent Condition
    </b>
    <br />
    Item is in excellent condition. Little to no sign of previous wear. Item is in excellent ready-to-wear condition and has zero flaws. Shoes may have some wear on outsoles, but heels are not worn down at all; jackets & suits have a like-new appearance but have had the pockets opened and used, etc. 
    <br /><br />

    <br /><br />
    <b>
	3/5 - Good Condition
    </b>
    <br />
    Item is in good, ready-to-wear condition but shows signs of being pre-owned. Heels of shoes may be worn, jacket linings may show wear, slight discoloration may appear on collar of shirts, etc. Item will not require any repair prior to being worn.
    <br /><br />
    <a href="ebay/929.html">Good Condition Jacket</a> (No actual flaws, but has worn linings at the armpit and some staining on the lining from an ink pen.)
    <br /><br />
    <b>
	2/5 - Flawed Condition
    </b>
    <br />
    Item has obvious flaws, but is <i>wearable</i>. Small holes in fabrics, very worn soles of shoes. Repair may be needed for the garment to be satisfactory to you. Many vintage items fall under this condition. Small moth holes in a vintage sweater would rate it as a 2/5, but you may find the flaws to be acceptable. 
    <br /><br />
    <a href="ebay/930.html">Flawed Condition</a> (Perfect condition, but has wear through the fabric at the crotch.)
    <br /><br />
    <b>
	1/5 - Damaged
    </b>
    <br />
    Item needs repair before it can be worn. May not be able to be repaired. We don't generally sell items in this condition, but may offer something if it has usable fabric, etc.
